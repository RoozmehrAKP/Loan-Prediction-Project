Description: Developed and evaluated multiple machine learning models to predict loan approval
outcomes based on customer financial profiles and repayment history. The project aimed to enhance
decision-making accuracy in banking and reduce financial risk.

Key Highlights:
  •Implemented Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and ANN for loan classification.
  •Evaluated models based on accuracy, error rate, and false positive rate.
  •Improved loan approval accuracy from 70% to 85%.
  •Enhanced risk management by increasing high-risk customer identification from 65% to 80%.
  •Recommended ANN as the best model and Logistic Regression as an efficient alternative.
